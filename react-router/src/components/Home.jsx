          React Router is a library for handling navigation in React apps. It
          allows you to define routes and render components based on the URL.
          With features like nested routes, route parameters, and dynamic
          routing, it supports building complex UIs. React Router ensures
          seamless navigation without page reloads. Itâ€™s ideal for creating
          single-page applications with multiple views.
